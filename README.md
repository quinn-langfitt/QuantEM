Error detection will be an integral part of quantum processing, especially for near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage. Unfortunately, adding quantum error detection (QED) to arbitrary quantum circuits is a daunting task as deep knowledge of detecting codes and required circuit modifications is required. 

This project contains the first Python-based compiler that automatically integrates QED into quantum circuits. High-level quantum programs are translated into error-detectable low-level circuits that are quantum machine compatable. 

## Getting Started
Please visit the `example_notebooks` directory for `qed_compiler` tutorials.
