#### `QuantEM`: the quantum error management compiler

---
Error detection will be an integral part of quantum processing, especially for near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage. Unfortunately, adding quantum error detection (QED) to arbitrary quantum circuits is a daunting task as deep knowledge of detecting codes and required circuit modifications is required.

This project contains the first Python-based compiler that automatically integrates QED into quantum circuits. High-level quantum programs are translated into error-detectable low-level circuits that are quantum machine compatable.

## Getting Started

To install the `quantem` package from source:

```sh
pip install .
```

<br>
Please visit the `example_notebooks` directory for `qed_compiler` tutorials. The additional dependencies needed to run the notebooks can be installed using:

```sh
pip install .[notebook]
```

## Supported QED Protocols

+ **Pauli Check Sandwiching, PCS**: PCS is technique used to detect and mitigate errors. PCS surrounds a payload circuit, $ùëà$ , with controlled Pauli operator checks that are selected such that $RUL = ùëà$ . Errors on $ùëà$ can be detected
on an ancilla through phase kickback. The errors that are detected in $U$ anticommute with the Pauli operators in the selected checks.
+ **Ancilla-free Pauli Checks, AFPC**: AFPC does not include an ancilla that is measured for syndrome information. Instead, syndrome information is read out directly from the qubit targeted by Pauli checks. AFPC is effective for application-specific error characterization.
+ **Pauli Check Extrapolation, PCE** ((*Coming Soon*))
+ **Iceberg Code** (*Coming Soon*)
